<b>Finance: </b>
<br>
The finance section comprises of two options. Regular Invoice and Custom Invoice. Regular Invoice provides preset values where custom Invoice allows for free text. Both invoices are then saved on the desktop or a folder of your choice before being emailed to the client.
The school value in Finance is populated from the database of schools that are added by the user.
